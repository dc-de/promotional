The Red Eclipse Team is proud to announce their new release, version 1.3 codenamed "Galactic Edition".

This release sees a semi-stabilisation of the gameplay in favour of implementing a variety of bugfixes and user requests. We've removed some old cruft and implemented a few new game types to replace them, like coop (humans fight high powered bots), and king-of-the-hill (control and defend one flag). Due to the popularity of the impulse/parkour system we have introduced a new "impulse vaulting", where you can hold down your parkour key to "vault" over low obstacles, making it that much easier to navigate around busy levels.

We invite you to download it and give it a go, each release brings us that much closer to a polished game. If you have any feedback, feel free to visit our forums at http://www.redeclipse.net/forum and let us know what you think. We're also still looking for a new trailer to be featured on our home page, as the one we are using now is 4 releases old! If you think you can help make a professional video, check out the thread on our forums: http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=72&t=2237

We hope you enjoy playing this game as much as we enjoy creating it. As always, you can download Red Eclipse from our website: http://www.redeclipse.net/
