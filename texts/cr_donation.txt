Thank you for your donation, your contribution is most appreciated and know that every little bit counts!

To show my appreciation I would like to offer you a chance to appear in our Credits. If you consent, please tell me if you would like to have your full name or just your nickname appear. They appear like this in our README:

> FirstName "nickname" Lastname

Additionally, if you don't already have an account, I can provide you with one to show off your supporter status. If you'd like to do this please don't hesitate to reply with the username you would like to use (alphanumeric characters only, no spaces or punctuation) or the handle you already use in-game.

Regards,
