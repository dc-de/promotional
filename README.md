# Promotional Repository
Welcome to the official Red Eclipse promotional repository, for social (and other) media purposes.

This section is intended for use by contributors to share their work in a collaborative manner in order to improve the presence of the project.

If you upload to this repository, it is taken that you agree to transfer your rights to the Lead Developer for Red Eclipse, Quinton Reeves, in order redistribute the content under his terms. *This includes accepting that any royalties and/or revenue generated through our redistribution of the content belong the Lead Developer for Red Eclipse, Quinton Reeves, and will be used as he deems fit.*

## Assets
These are things that don't belong anywhere else in the project as another repository that is already included in-game (like: fonts, sounds, textures, etc). You should use the "Akashi" and "Play Bold" from the [fonts repsository](https://github.com/red-eclipse/fonts) when producing material for Red Eclipse as it will help maintain a consistent look. When looking for icons or other images to use in your work, it is recommended (but not required) you source what you can from the [textures repository](https://github.com/red-eclipse/textures).

## Sequences
This is for sections of content that have a potential for being reused. Specific cuts of recordings in either audio or video format can often help with the production of further content.

## Texts
These are little bits of text that have been used over the years for the promotion of Red Eclipse.

# Releases
The *releases* area is a safe haven for finished projects, and should only contain the finished files required for those productions (no raw video or cuts for the sake of size). In general you should have an "audio" track (this allows us to post it to sound/podcast sharing services), a "video" track (optional), a "thumbnail", and a "description".
