# Promotional Repository
Welcome to the official Red Eclipse promotional repository, for social (and other) media purposes.

This section is intended for use by contributors to share their work in a collaborative manner in order to improve the presence of the project.

If you upload to this repository, it is taken that you agree to share your rights to the content with Red Eclipse in order redistribute the content under their terms. *This includes accepting that any royalties and/or revenue generated through the redistribution of the content conducted by Red Eclipse will be kept in the pool of funds for use by the project.*

## Assets
These are things that don't belong anywhere else in the project as another repository that is already included in-game (like: fonts, sounds, textures, etc). You should use the "Akashi" and "Play Bold" from the [fonts repository](https://github.com/redeclipse/fonts) when producing material for Red Eclipse as it will help maintain a consistent look. When looking for icons or other images to use in your work, it is recommended (but not required) you source what you can from the [textures repository](https://github.com/redeclipse/textures).

## Sequences
This is for sections of content that have a potential for being reused. Specific cuts of recordings in either audio or video format can often help with the production of further content.

## Texts
These are little bits of text that have been used over the years for the promotion of Red Eclipse.

## Colors
These are colors that are used in the game itself or in accompanying material.

# Releases
The *releases* area is a safe haven for finished projects, and should only contain the finished files required for those productions (no raw video or cuts for the sake of size). In general you should have an "audio" track (this allows us to post it to sound/podcast sharing services), a "video" track (optional), a "thumbnail", and a "description".
